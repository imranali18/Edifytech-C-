In This Chapter

In this chapter we will get familiar with primitive types and variables in C# – what they are and how to work with them. 
First we will consider the data types – integer types, real types with floating-point, Boolean, character, string and object type. 
We will continue with the variables, with their characteristics, how to declare them, how they are assigned a value and what a variable 
initialization is. We will get familiar with the two major sets of data types in C# – value types and reference types. Finally we will 
examine different types of literals and their usage. 

What is a Variable
------------------
A typical program uses various values that change during its execution. For example, we create a program that performs some calculations 
on the values entered by the user. The values entered by one user will obviously be different from those entered in by another user. This
means that when creating the program, the programmer does not know what values will be introduced as input, and that makes it necessary to
process all possible values a user may enter. When a user enters a new value that will be used in the process of calculation, we can 
preserve it (temporarily) in the random access memory of our computer. The values in this part of memory change (vary) throughout execution
and this has led to their name – variables













Making Choices
---------------

-  One of the fundamental reason of using programming is to solve problems.

-  A major portion of problem solving involves decision making therefore very early
on in the course we will learn about Boolean Types in Python.

- We will build Boolean expressions and understand their outcomes and get acquainted with
operators in Python.

- If-Else statements (Also called control flow statements) play an important role in
structuring the flow of decision making steps in programs. We will discuss those as well.


Topics for Today
----------------

-  Comparison Operators

-  Boolean Types

-  If-Else Statements
